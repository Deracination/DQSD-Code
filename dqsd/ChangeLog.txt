-- What's new for 3.0 (June 28, 2002)

Search bar

* New cascading help menu
* Most-recently-used list on help menu
* Support for DEL key and CTRL-INS, etc. cut/copy/paste
* Fix for problems on machines set for non-English character encoding
* Ability to enable/disable searches in the help window
* Shift-Enter on search forces new browser window (overrides reuseBrowserWindowMode)
* Search history search (enter part of a previous search and press f8)
* Improved installer and version checking
* Calender - some bug fixes
* Lots of minor bug fixes
* Global hot key (WIN - S) to jump to DQSD from any application
* "?" followed by a string displays all searches with that string in the search or
  description


New Preferences

* helptime - Time for which help text is displayed at startup
* startdelay - Setting this to a large number (milliseconds) may help with the 
               missing tray icons
* calStart - calendar can be started with double click rather than right-click
* helpSortKey - Choose whether searches are sorted by name or alias
* displayHelp - Set this to false to stop display of help strings 'Quick Search' 
                and 'Display ? for help'
??? - there are lots more than this


Customisation

* All visual styling of DQSD elements moved to search.css with localsearch.css override
* localprefs.js added to allow local override of preferences
* parseArgs 
  A.  Rewrote parse args to solve the problem of switches that were
  never defined to be switches from being removed from the query.  This
  caused problems with functions that use switches and expect a url
  parameter (http://www.yahoo.com would become http:/.yahoo.com due to
  the parsing).
  B.  Added an optional third parameter to the function that will
  disable the switch expansion (/b becomes /books).  A complicated
  search that expects the '/' character in the query can use this to
  avoid any problems.
  C.  Added another output property which returns the switches in an
  associative array.  In other words /foo:bar will be returned as
  switch_val["foo"] with the value "bar". The function should still 
  be backwards compatible so existing searches do not have to be 
  modified.

* isURL -
  Added the function isURL which determines if a given string is an
  http or https url or not.  If it is it will return the string, and if
  it is not, it will return false.  If the string looks like a dns
  name, the function will prefix the string with "http://" before
  returning it.  

* convertStylesToInline - a new function called convertStylesToInline 
  which is used to shoehorn the stylesheet into a window.createPopup 
  spawned popup.  

* Added function nullArgs.  I noticed that all of the functions that 
  I've written open the search link () if the query is null and raise 
  an alert with the  if the query is "?".  The nullArgs function 
  encapsulates all of this.  With nullArgs, the user does not have 
  to write a different version of the description for HTML and for the 
  alert.  This may be a good way to standardize searches so that the 
  user knows that he can find help about a function by calling it 
  with a "?" as the only argument.

* localaliases.txt - Added name and description fields

* Support for Add-ons - see FAQ

           available functions and see a list of results.  For example, 
           "qsfind yahoo" will create a popup that displays the list of 
           searches that have something to do with yahoo.  Then if the 
           user clicks on the function name, the text will pre-fill the 
           search dialog box.
