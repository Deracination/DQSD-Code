      <question>I've installed it, but I want to uninstall it, and I can't figure out how! Help!</question>
      <answer>Right-click on the shoe to the left and choose 'Close Toolbar'. Then find the uninstaller under the control panel. Some people find the control panel entry, but they don't know they need to close DQSD before uninstalling. </answer>
