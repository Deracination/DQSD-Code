  Nupedia is a new online, peer-reviewed, international encyclopedia.  It is searchable and will also be organized hierarchically and alphabetically.  Nupedia is "open content" or "free"; we want the contents of the encyclopedia to receive the widest possible distribution.  Reading Nupedia.com will always be free of charge and therefore the project of building it depends on volunteers--possibly you!
