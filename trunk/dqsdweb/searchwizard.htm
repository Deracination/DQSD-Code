I find one of the biggest pains in writing a new DQSD search is finding and
massaging the correct HTML FORM into well-formed XML.  I finally got annoyed enough to
write a little utility to do some of the work for me.
</p>

<p>
I call it <b>Dave's Quick Search Deskbar Search Wizard</b>.

<h3>What does it do?</h3>

<p>
In a nutshell, it creates a DQSD search from the page currently displayed in your browser.
</p>

<p>
One of the first things you typically do when creating a new search is to view the source for the page containing the FORM INPUT elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's tedious.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's hard to find the right FORM when there are multiple FORMs in the page.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's error-prone because I have to convert the HTML to well-formed XML (and I always forget to close the INPUT elements with "/>").
</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the web page with the search.</li>
<li>Click in the field you want to be receive the search string.</li>
<li>Start up the wizard by clicking on its Internet Explorer toolbar button:<br/>

</center>
</li>
<li>
You should see a dialog that looks something like the following.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter a name and a title.&nbsp;&nbsp;(The name is the string that will invoke the search and will be used name the file, so keep it short and simple.)<br/>
<center><img src="dqsdsearchwiz.jpg" align="top"></center>
</li>
<li>Hit OK and you'll be prompted to save the search file to your DQSD 'searches' directory.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
In the screenshot above, I went to <a href="http://www.msnbc.com">http://www.msnbc.com</a>, clicked in the search field to make it 'active'...<br/>
<center><img src="msnbc.jpg"></center>
Then I invoked the wizard, entered 'msnbc' for the name, and 'MSNBC News' for the title (the title is what appears in the menu and help).&nbsp;&nbsp;All the FORM elements in the page are listed, with the one checked that contains the 'active' element.
