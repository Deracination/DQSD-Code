(<a href="#new">What's New</a>)</center>

<p align="center" style="color: red; font-size: 8pt">
(Stay tuned... The all new and improved version 3.0 will be released any day now!)
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>
does it right: they
are <em>fast</em>. Their loadtime is quick. Their searches
are instantaneous. Voila!  What could be faster?

<p>Good question. You know that the
<a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#lucky">I'm Feeling Lucky button</a>
speeds things up. So does a shortcut to Google on your taskbar,
and so does the official <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">Google Toolbar</a>.
And maybe you're already using all that.

<p>Still need to go faster? <a href=#install>Install
<b>Dave's Quick Search Deskbar</b></a>. It launches Google,
Yahoo and other searches straight from your desktop taskbar.

<p>Dave thinks it's indispensable; you can also
read what <a href="reviews.htm">other users around the Internet say</a>.

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p><b>Dave's Quick Search Deskbar</b> is
a tiny textbox that Dave Bau designed for search hounds with
weary mouse-fingers. Unlike the Google Toolbar,
this little deskbar lets you launch searches without starting
a web browser first, directly from your Windows Explorer Taskbar.

<p><center><img src=toolbar.gif></center></p>

<p>You type your search and hit Enter
for a regular Google search.

<p>If you're feeling lucky,
tack an exclamation point on to the end of your search -
"<b>pow!</b>" - and go directly to the top ranked hit.
It is Powered By Google, and Yes it Really Works.

<p>Now you can do searches
no matter what you are doing - email, word processing,
programming, whatever.

<p>There's more. You're not a captive to Google.
Do Yahoo searches with a "<b>question?</b>", get Merriam-Webster
definitions with a "<b>colon:</b>", get Bloomberg stock quotes
like this "<b>msft intc csco$</b>", and find Switchboard
phone numbers by saying "<b>Lois Lane#</b>".
You can search real "<b>news.</b>" search "<b>newsgroups,</b>"
check "<b>weather*</b>", or "<b>comparison shop$$</b>".
There's a built in calculator when you need to know
"<b>pow(1.0625, 30)</b>" is 6.1640785. And so on.

<p>Too much to remember? Under IE 5.5 or better there's a little
menu that shows you all your choices.
Not enough space on your deskbar? It includes a clock so that you
can free up some space by turning off the system deskbar clock.

<p>Missing a feature you need? If you know HTML
and want to add your own functionality, you can -
it is distributed under <a href="#license">GPL</a>.

<p>It'll make you super-quick.

<p>You'll be ready to take on the world and surf like never before.

<h3><a name=install>Installation Instructions</a></h3>


<p>Want it? First off, you need to be running Windows 95 or better
and using IE 5.0 or newer. It's been tested with IE 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0,
on Windows 95, 98, 2000, and XP. (Please let me know if it
works on various other configurations.)

<p>Here's what you do:

<ol>
<li>Run the following setup program. ("Run this program from its current
location" is fine.)

<center><p><b><a href="dqsd.exe">Dave's Quick Search Deskbar Version 2.5.7</a></b></p></center>

<p>It will install the deskbar in the "<em>Quick Search Deskbar</em>" folder
in your "<em>Program Files</em>" directory, along with sources and an
uninstallation program.
</p>

<li>Clear out a nice empty gray space on your taskbar by closing some apps,
then right-click on the empty gray part of the taskbar, and select the menu
Toolbars > Add Quick Search...

<center><p><img src=addquicksearch.gif></p></center>

<p>If "<em>Add Quick Search</em>" doesn't appear, wait ten seconds and
try again - Windows takes a few seconds to discover the existence of
a newly installed deskbar.
</p>

<li>You're done! <b>Dave's Quick Search Deskbar</b> has appeared on your taskbar.
Drag things around so that it's just the right size and in the right place.

<center><p><img src=donetoolbar.gif></p></center>

<li><p><b>Saving screen real estate.</b>
Since screen real estate on the taskbar is precious, you probably
want to get rid of the little caption that says "Search" by
right-clicking it and unchecking "Show Title".  And since the search
bar includes its own clock, you probably want to remove the
system clock from the system tray by right-clicking in the empty space
in the taskbar and selecting "Properties", then unchecking "Show Clock".

<center><p><table><tr><td><img src=notitle.gif></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><img src=noclock.gif></td></tr></table></p></center>

</ol>

<p>Type ? and hit Enter in the search box to get more information about other features.

<p>
<hr size=1>
<h3>Alternate Installation Instructions</h3>

<p>Some users of Windows 98SE and Windows ME
have reported that the search bar does
not show up when they follow the steps above. Here is another way
you can install the search bar that works if the regular way does not
work:

<ol>
<li>Download and run <a href="dqsd.exe">dqsd.exe</a> as usual.
<li>Right-click on your Windows Explorer taskbar and select Toolbars > Add New Toolbar...
<li>When it prompts you for a folder, type in the following URL: <b>http://notesbydave.com/toolbar/install.htm</b> (be sure not to copy in any spaces at the beginning or the end)
<li>The Quick Search bar should appear.
</ol>

<h3>Alternate Alternate Installation Instructions</h3>

<p>The trick above only works if your program files directory is on
your C: drive. If it's on your D: drive you'll want to use a different
URL, and if it's on your E: drive, there's yet another one.

<ul>
<li>D: drive users can try <b>http://notesbydave.com/toolbar/installd.htm</b>
<li>E: drive users can try <b>http://notesbydave.com/toolbar/installe.htm</b>
</ul>

<p>
<hr size=1>
<h3>Support</h3>

<p>There is a new discussion forum that Glenn Carr has set up
for support, ideas, and enhancements. If you've got any, please
<a href="mailto:dqsd-users@lists.sourceforge.net">email</a> them
to the dqsd-users@lists.sourceforge.net group. (An archive
of the list is
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dqsd-users@lists.sourceforge.net/">here.</a>)
(Note, we're moving away from the old forum on Yahoo because
the advertisements and downtime have become too annoyting.)

<p>
<hr size=1>
<h3>Uninstallation Instructions</h3>

<p>If you are unhappy with your <b>Dave's Quick Search Deskbar</b>,
<a href="mailto:davidbau@hotmail.com">email Dave</a> to complain,
or check the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dqsdd">old</a>
or <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dqsd-users@lists.sourceforge.net/">new</a>
discussion group archives to see if there is a workaround.
Maybe somebody has already found a fix.
In the meantime, it's easy to uninstall.

<ol>
<li>Right-click on the "Search" caption of the deskbar (or the little gripper
to the left of the deskbar if you've hidden the caption) and select "Close".

<li>Then, to unintall the files and registry entries, go to the control panel
and click on "Add/Remove Programs". You'll find an entry for
"Dave's Quick Search Deskbar", which you can use to run the uninstaller.
</ol>

<p>This erases it from your computer without a trace.

<p>
<hr size=1>
<h3>Some Notes for Real Search Hounds</h3>

<p><b>Search Menu</b>. If you have IE 5.5 or better, you can
get a menu of searches by clicking on the
<b style=background:lightgrey>&#x0BB;</b> button that is
available to the right of the textbox. So you don't need to
remember the punctuation.

<p>The menu button will not appear if the deskbar is too narrow;
it won't show itself if it would take up more than some percentage
of the deskbar's screen real estate.

<p>Even if the menu button isn't being shown, you can
display the menu of choices by typing "F1" key
while you're entering your search terms (you'll still
need IE 5.5 or better for this feature). You can continue
editing your search while the menu is shown.

<p><b>People Lookups</b>. Most names are too common to do
ordinary lookups. If you say
<center><b>Jackie Jones#</b></center>
you will get hundreds of hits. So you can specify the state
and, if you like, the city too. You put them in parentheses,
like this:
<center><b>Jackie Jones (ca)#</b></center>
<center><b>Jackie Jones (san fransisco, ca)#</b></center>
If you specify the city, you need to say the state, but
not the other way around.

<p><b>Drag and Drop</b>. Drag and drop is pretty neat.
If you drop in some text, it opens a Google search directly
so that you don't need to hit Enter. It trims punctuation
for you so you don't search newsgroups just because you
dragged in a comma.

<p>If an instant Google search is not what you want,
then just use cut and paste. The regular cut and paste
keys ctrl-C, ctrl-X, and ctrl-V do work. (It wasn't easy.)

<p><b>Calculator</b>. The deskbar has a built-in Javascript
calculator that lets you evaluate ordinary Javascript
expressions using an "=" sign, e.g., "9*(3+22.4)=" will
give you "228.6". If you type in something that looks like
a math expression without the equals sign, the calculator will
also try to evaluate it.

<p>The code is executed within Javascript's Math package, which
gives you access to various functions and mathematical constants.
For example, "cos(pi)+sin(pi/2)" gives you "0".

<p>You have access to the entire execution environment of the
page, so you can show the about box with "abt()=" or do an Ask
Jeeves search with "ask('why')=", etc. All the
single-letter variable names are left for your use, so they are
useful as memory for your calculator.

<p>If you say "x=4344", then "x*x-x" later on will yield
"18865992".

<p><b>Search History</b>. The deskbar remembers your last
50 searches. You can use ctrl-P (Previous) and ctrl-N (Next)
to browse through your history of searches. If your deskbar
is not docked in the taskbar, you can use the up and
down arrow keys for the same thing.

<p><b>Babelfish Translation</b>. You can translate words or
web pages through AltaVista's Babelfish translator like this:
"algunas palabras es-en" translates some words from Spanish
to English, and "calvinone.net pt-en" translates a web page
from Portugese to English. Supported translation codes include
include en-zh, en-fr, en-de, en-it, en-ja, en-ko, en-pt,
en-es, zh-en, fr-en, fr-de, de-en, de-fr, it-en, ja-en,
ko-en, pt-en, ru-en, and es-en.

<p><b>XE Currency Converter</b>. You can convert between
currencies using current rates by typing "100 usd>gbp"
to see how many British pounds you get for $100 U.S. Dollars.
There are currency codes for every currency you can think
of (eur, dem, jpy, frf, itl, aud, cad, hkd...). There is a
complete list of three-letter currency codes
<a href=http://www.xe.com/ucc/full.shtml>here on xe.com</a>.

<p><b>Other Shortcuts</b>. There are several more shortcuts
that you can use.  Here is a partial list:

</center>

<p>The list above is just a partial list: a more complete list can
be accessed by typing "?" in the quick search bar.

<p><b>Dave's favorite searches</b>. When a Google search fails,
Dave usually goes to the FAST engine search next.

<p>Why? Dave finds that the main problem with Google is that its
view of the Web is a month or more out-of-date. So Google is no
good when Dave is searching for something new.
The FAST engine reindexes the internet every
12 days, so it's a fresher view than Google.

<p><b>Launching addresses</b>. Some things that you type into the
textbox will not launch a search.
If you type in what looks like a URL (http://foo.com/bar),
a DNS name (foo.co.jp), a local filename (c:\foo\bar), or a UNC
name (\\foo\bar\file), it will open those directly.
If you type one of the bits of special punctuation without
a search term, it
will open an appropriate page for that service. (Some are
nice; for example, * is great because AccuWeather remembers
your previously specified zip code.)

<p><b>Launching addresses faster</b>. A lot of websites
have DNS names like "www.joelonsoftware.com".
To zap to these sites even faster, you can just type in
"joelonsoftware" and type control-Enter, and it works just
like the IE address bar does with control-Enter.
It'll add the www. and the .com parts for you.

<p><b>Reverse Phone Number Lookup</b>.
If you type in what looks like a phone number (including
area code), it will do an AnyWho reverse phone number lookup.

<p><b>What about other search engines?</b> As I mentioned before,
you're free to modify the code and even redistribute it
as allowed under GPL.
See the <a href="#contributing">Contributing</a> section
below for more information on modifying the source code.
If you add a cool feature, please let me know.

<p><b>What about Linux?</b>

For your GNOME desktop, you might want to check out
<a href="http://websearcher.sourceforge.net/">WebSearcher</a>
on Source Forge, which seems to have similar UI. (I've never
tried it.)

<p><b>What about Windows NT?</b>

It works, but you've got to get Active Desktop enabled on NT,
which can take some contortions.
<a href="http://www.jeffwinkler.com/">Jeff Winkler</a> offers
the following tip:

"Took me a while to get it going under NT/SP6 because I
hadn't enabled Active Desktop -- there were no toolbars
in my taskbar. It's fairly tricky - instructions are at
<a href="http://www.jsiinc.com/SUBG/TIP3200/rh3235.htm"
>http://www.jsiinc.com/SUBG/TIP3200/rh3235.htm</a>"

<p><b>What about Netscape or other non-IE browsers?</b>

<b>Update</b>: As of version 2.5.0, thanks to Koen Mannaerts
code contribution, you should now be
able to launch Netscape, Opera, or other non-IE browsers
using the deskbar. This normally works out-of-the box
just fine: searches are launched using your default
browser. However, sometimes, the deskbar can be tricked
into believing that IE is your default browser when it
is not. If this is happening to you, you can edit your
"preferences.js" file and change "launchmode" from 2 to 1.

<p><b>What about the DEL key?</b>

There appears to be a bug in the way Windows Explorer hosts IE
on the deskbar that prevents deskbar-hosted pages from hearing
about DEL keypresses (actually, according to
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dqsdd/message/170">Sidney
Chong</a>, none of the onkeyup or onkeydown events are
being passed to the deskbar).
So the DEL key doesn't work. If anybody
figures out a fix for this problem, please let me know!

<a name="new"><h3>What's New</h3></a>

<p><b><a href="dqsd257.exe">Version 2.5.7</a></b> (April 1, 2002)
was coordinated by Glenn Carr (through six beta releases)
and adds the following features contributed by the open source
community:

<ol>
<li>New searches: reget, winres, day, rgb, hexconv, chart, phone, multi

<li>Removed currency.js and phoneno.js, all the script needed for those
'searches' are in their respective XML files. Monty added an autodetect_*
method for each search. This might also speed the load (but not sure)

<li>Rework of switch parsing; addition of parseArgs() method

<li>Neel Doshi's changes to tools.js to correct the browser launch mode

<li>Added searches Downseek, TechWeb Encyclopedia, Borland Newsgroup
Database by Tom Corcoran

<li>Added telephone country code lookup by Stephen Montgomery

<li>Shortcuts have been fixed so that entries in localaliases.txt that
contain
backslashes don't require escaping those backslashes. I.e., instead
of...
<pre>run explorer /e, "C:\\Program Files\\Quick Search Deskbar"
</pre>...the actual path should be used...
<pre>run explorer /e, "C:\Program Files\Quick Search Deskbar"</pre>

<li>Updated ZDNet search from John Bairen

<li>The following variables can now be used to customize the help fonts
and help window...

<pre>
helpstyle // contains standard CSS style settings
helpoptions // contains options for the window.open() options
</pre>

Here are some examples that could be used in preferences.js to
increase the font size and to modify the help window...

<pre>
helpstyle = "font-size:12pt";
// the following are not CSS styles, but options
// passed to window.open()
helpoptions = "width=800, height=550, status=yes"
</pre>

<li>Modified the 'run' command to allow passing parameters to an
executable.
E.g., you can now enter:
<pre>run explorer e, C:\Program Files\Quick Search Deskbar"</pre>

Or, an alias can be defined in localaliases.txt like this:
<pre>run explorer /e, "%s"</pre>

...so that you can enter:
<pre>exp C:\Program Files\Quick Search Deskbar"</pre>

This required a change to the DQSDTools.Launcher component (the
OpenDocument
method has a second optional argument which takes the parameters.)

<li>Fix for the mysterious disappearing dollar signs in the help that JB
found.

<li>Added RobbyH's SurfWax search - "sw horses"

<li>Monty added helpful comments to preferences.js

<li>New searches/functions submitted by Tom and Monty:
<pre>
fd - Free On-Line dictionary of computing: "fd xhtml"
fe - The File Extension Source fe {[a..z] | num | sym }: "fe d"
js - European specialist job site
tm - Teoma search using Subject Specific Popularity : "tm denali"
uktv - UK Television guide
base - Convert decimal values to hex, octal and binary
equivalents
ascii - Convert ASCII characters to decimal, hex, octal
and binary equivalents
</pre>

<li>Glenn added expanding/collapsing help categories

<li>support for comments (leading '//') for alias files

<li>localaliases.txt isn't overwritten on install

<li>sync names of search files with function names
</ol>


<p><b><a href="dqsd256.exe">Version 2.5.6</a></b> adds the following:

<ol>
<li>Ryan Edwards fixed drag-and-drop, which I inadvertently broke
right before packaging up 2.5.5 for release.
<li>Tom J. Corcoran added a whatis.com search.
<li>Other miscellaneous fixes.
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd255.exe">Version 2.5.5</a></b> includes the following
improvements:

<ol>
<li>Glenn Carr added a mechanism so that searches can be loaded from
a searches directory instead of a huge search.xml file.
<li>Monty Scroggins and others ported the search.xml file into the
new format.
<li>Ryan Edwards added infrastructure so that all searches that use
option switches do it the same way.
<li>Several new searches were added, and several bugs were fixed.
</ol>

This is the first release where Dave hasn't followed the development
of the code in enough detail to provide a detailed log here. If
anybody has a better changelog, please mail it to Dave!

<p><b><a href="dqsd254.exe">Version 2.5.4</a></b> merges the following
contributions from the discussion group:

<ol>
<li>Olney Lee (xtrecate) contributed an AstaLaVista
    computer security search ("crax")

<li>Kjetil Limkjaer contributed norwegian and dutch strings
<li>Michael Baas contributed german strings
<li>Glenn Carr improved the reverse phone number regex
<li>Glenn Carr added a feature so that you can control when DQSD spawns
   new windows
<li>Glenn Carr added a feature so that you can control when DQSD uses
   a multiline textbox.
<li>The CIA world fact book is added as a reference
<li>Glenn Carr updated the mapquest search to match the changed website
<li>Monty Scroggins improved the cpan search
<li>John W. Bairen contributed a pc magazine and a zdnet search

<li>Glenn Carr fixed the aim function so that it behaves better when
    AIM isn't installed.
<li>Monty Scroggins and John W. Bairen improved navigation inside the
    ? help window.
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd253.exe">Version 2.5.3</a></b> adds a bunch of
new functionality and reorganizes the code significantly:

<ol>
<li>Thanks to help from Monty Scroggins, all the searches are moved
into search.xml now. Search.htm is much smaller. the format of
search.xml has changed. Shortcuts are no longer defined in this file;
instead, they are defined in aliases.txt, and the menu layout is in
menu.txt. Search.htm is exploded out to several different .js files.
<li>Some of the default mnemonics for searches have been changed. Every
search can now be done via a command like "gg" for google. The
searches listed in the "?" help box are now organized into categories
so it's slightly easier to find things.
<li>Adam Stiles figured out why it wasn't correctly launching NetCaptor,
and now it's fixed to work correctly!
<li>Glenn Carr added a feature so that the history is persistent (it
is saved accross reboots). It's saved in history.txt.
<li>The calculator memory (single-letter variables) is also persistent.
It's saved in calcmem.txt.
<li>The history now supports a "find previous command" feature: if you
previously searched for "foo bart", you can now type "!fo" or "!bar"
to recall the search; or you can use ctrl-P/ctrl-N to scroll through
all the matching searches. "!!" redoes the most recent search.
(If you want the "I'm feeling lucky" shortcut, the "!" needs to
be at the end.)
<li>The input box is multiline instead of single-line (this feature
was suggested by Mark Zeren).
<li>There is an option (buttonalign="left") to move the button to the
left (as requested by Mitch G).
<li>Erik Hartmann contributed an aol IM shortcut a long time ago that
I've finally gotten around to pasting in. I haven't tested it because
I haven't installed AIM yet - and this should be changed so that it
behaves better when aim isn't installed.
<li>There are two new UK-oriented searches (suggested by David Brake):
cdo searchs Cambridge Dictionary Online for a British view of the
English language, and mm searches multimap.com for addresses in the
UK.
<li>Reginald Braithwaite-Lee contributed a bomis.com search
<li>Stephen Granade contributed a better bartleby.com quotations search
<li>Volker Wick contributed Fahrenheit to Celsius (and vice versa)
conversion
<li>Monty Scroggins contributed a hotscripts search for searching
for resources for various scripting languages simultaneously.
<li>Translations go to freetranslations.com where possible instead of
going to AltaVista. en-no is added.
<li>An assortment of bugs were fixed (in history, cut/paste, selection,
layout, IE 5.0 problems, installation problems, etc, etc.).
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd252.exe">Version 2.5.2</a></b> includes
the following improvements:

<ol>
<li>Rick Olson contributed an improved pricewatch search - "pw ram:64mb".
The old $$$ search is still there but will probably be removed soon.
<li>Monty Scroggins added a perl cpan search - "cpan CGI" (case-sensitive)
<li>Glenn Carr fixed a bug in the Vivisimo search identified by Paul Shotts.
<li>Nik Devereaux added an option to force the menu button on or off
  (showbutton = 0:off, 1:on, 2:(default)auto)
<li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/eduardofernandez">Eduardo
J. Fernandez Corrales</a> contributed the rest of the needed
  Spanish localization strings.
<li>There's a new "run" command that just does a ShellExecute,
  e,g, "run winword" launches Microsoft Word.
<li>The popup calendar now updates "today" correctly when it's tomorrow.
<li>DNS names followed by slashed paths are now treated as http URLs
<li>There is an option to turn off the popup calendar (cal=false) as
  requested by Mitch G.
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd251.exe">Version 2.5.1</a></b>
is a bugfix release:

<ol>
<li>Launching Yahoo calendar correctly appears to require timezone
adjustments. These have been added.
<li>Some calendar rendering problems have been fixed (the current
day is highlighted on Sundays; the calendar can navigate faster;
and it puts itself away in the right situations).
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd250.exe">Version 2.5.0</a></b>
introduces some significant improvements:

<ol>
<li>Thanks to Koen Mannaerts, Glenn Carr, and Monty Scroggins,
this version is capable of launching your default browser even
if it is not IE. It works with Netscape, Opera, and others.
(Koen graciously made the ActiveX control that
makes this possible available under GPL; the original
idea came from his
<a href="http://www.whirlywiryweb.com/q/launchinie.asp">LaunchInIE</a>
control, which was introduced to us by Monty Scroggins.
And Glenn came up with a way to handle POSTed forms through
temporary files, so that changes to search.xml are minimal.)
<li>Sidney Chong added a terrific calendar (that I hacked
up a bit). Get it by right-clicking in the deskbar.
Preferences.js can be used to customize it to launch yahoo,
msn, aol, netscape, mycalendar, or evite calendar services.
<li>Volker Wick contributed a bugfix in the ctrl-enter code.
<li>Jimmy Lin contributed a "start" search that uses a
natural language question answering system at MIT.
<li>Glenn Carr implemented Nik Devereaux's idea of a
MovieFone search: "mf Ocean's"
<li>Glenn Carr added a Bible search: "bible 1 cor 13:4-7"
<li>Glenn Carr implemented Chris Weiss's idea of ups and
fedex tracking number searches: "fedex [tracking#]" and
"ups [tracking#]"
<li>Glenn Carr added a Yahoo movie search: "ym Potter".
<li>Glenn added a date tooltip.
<li>Alain D contributed some French localization strings.
<li>Some more support for localization was added, partially
through my clumsy efforts to use online translation tools.
Please send in fixes or additional translations if you see
errors or omissions. German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and
other languages all have big omissions that need to be
filled.
<li>Also, thanks to Justin Frankel for quickly merging
a delta to NSIS 1.91 to help improve dqsd.exe setup.
</ol>

<p>Also new with this version: dqsd is on SourceForge. See
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dqsdd/message/264">this
message</a> for more information.

<p><b><a href="dqsd245.exe">Version 2.4.5</a></b>
is another bugfix release:
<ol>
<li>Tim Lara fixed a bug in 2.4.4 so that the calculator
works again.
<li>Glenn Carr added a yahoo movie search ("ym Ocean's Eleven").
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd244.exe">Version 2.4.4</a></b>
is a bugfix release:

<ol>
<li>Bjorn Jonson, Glenn Carr, Kjetil Limkjaer, and Greg Mitchell
quickly found and fixed a problem with the
Vivisimo part of search.xml that prevented it from working with
older versions of Microsoft's xml parser.
<li>Tim Lara contribted a formatting fix for the popup
menu that improves its rendering on some configurations.
<li>Edney Soares de Souza contributed Portugese localization
strings.
<li>Kjetil Limkjaer contributed Norwegian and Dutch
localization strings.
<li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/eduardofernandez">Eduardo
J. Fernandez Corrales</a> contributed Spanish
localization strings. We still need more languages!
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd243.exe">Version 2.4.3</a></b>
adds the following:

<ol>
<li>Jerome DeCock added localization and French strings
(thanks to Martin for the short month names). We still
need other languages!
<li>Nikolai Devereaux added an AcronymFinder search
("af nasa").
<li>Sam Gera suggested a Vivisimo search, and Glenn Carr
implemented one ("viv anything").
<li>Glenn Carr added a number of features, including
making more things customizable from preferences.js,
looking for a second xml file containing searches,
and making things work better when there are errors.
<li>Angus Johnson fixed drag-drop behavior so it copies
text instead of moving it.
<li>Errors are handled in a more robust way; layout
fits tighter with different font selections.
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd242.exe">Version 2.4.2</a></b>
adds two things:

<ol>
<li>Dave Maymudes contributed a <a href="dqsd.xml">PAD file</a>
to help automate distribution of the search bar on download sites.
<li>Glenn Carr made the popup menu formatting a bit more
robust.
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd241.exe">Version 2.4.1</a></b>
includes the following:

<ol>
<li>Jerome DeCock contriubted a date
formatting bugfix so unabbreviated monthnames work.
<li>Glenn Carr added a preferences.js file so that you
can preserve your preferences when you get new versions
of the deskbar. I've tweaked setup so that it doesn't
overwrite this file.
<li>Damian Maclennan contributed a sqlteam.com search
("sql triggers").
<li>Now if you type "!" it refreshes the code; and
the about box has helpful links for developers.
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd240.exe">Version 2.4.0</a></b>
has the following new features:

<ol>
<li>Sidney Chong added a clock that shows in the deskbar
after some idle time. This saves some screen real estate
by allowing you to remove the system clock.  I've
modified the clock to add some formatting options
using code from Matt Kruse. Glenn Carr helped fix
my buggy modifications.
<li>Bjorn Jonson merged Sidney's changes into the latest
version of the deskbar. He also contributed a new dns
dig search (try "unip yahoo.com").
<li>Monty Scroggins added a weather underground search
(by zip code - try "wug 75287").
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd234.exe">Version 2.3.4</a></b>
is another quick bugfix release:

<ol>
<li>Michael McWilliam noticed that 2.3.2 introduced some
changes that break the deskbar on IE 5.0 (that is what comes
with vanilla Windows 2000, so that is a lot of people).
This release fixes it, so you can now use the deskbar
again without having to upgrade IE beyond 5.0.
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd233.exe">Version 2.3.3</a></b>
has the following improvements:

<ol>
<li>Raul Costa noticed that a Windows 98 setup bug
(previously found by Edney Soares de Souza) somehow
crept back into the distribution. This is fixed again.
<li>Dan Sanderson's fancy Amazon search is added, so
you can search an individual Amazon store.
<li>Andrew Gilmartin's Access Medicine search is added.
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd232.exe">Version 2.3.2</a></b>
the code is a bit restructured to make
it easier to add new searches and manage your shortcut bindings.
I still haven't merged in all the cool searches that have been
posted yet, but it should now be easier to do this.
This version includes:
<ol>
<li>Glenn Carr's extensibility mechanism - now you can define
new searches in a convenient search.xml file.
<li>Stewart Rubenstein's Cambridgesoft chemfinder searches (in search.xml)
<li>Alternate Merriam-Webster thesaurus
<li>Adam Jury's Dictionary.com search
<li>Glenn Carr's additions for image, half, amaz, xref, and isbn searches.
<li>An autodocumentation feature so that the help in "?" is always accurate.
<li>James Gleick's alternate thesaurus (not enabled by default)
<li>Bugfixes from Jeff Winkler, Don Womick, Chris Farmer, and others.
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd221.exe">Version 2.2.1</a></b>
thanks to many contributors, this version
merges a bunch of neat new functionality from the
dqsdd discussion group. It includes:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">Chris Sell's</a>
PhoneSpell support (use "523-3113 #*"),
<li>Damian Maclennan's Samspade search (use "sams dnsname.com"),
<li>Chris Farmer's Newsgroup menu item, decimal regex (say ".4+1"), and autocomplete (off) bugfixes,
<li>Peter Risser's code to search various music databases (use "cdnow britney/t", "cddb britney/t", "alm britney/t"...),
<li>Brian Ross's bugfix for the broken dogpile search,
<li>Peter Risser's currency conversion (w/ Greg Mitchell's lowercase mods; use "100 usd>gbp"),
<li>Rick Olson's php and mysql searchs (use "php fopen" or "mysql alter table"),
<li>Greg Mitchell's babelfish translation (use "some words en-es"),
<li>Jelmer Cormont's request to be able to use long var names by saying "snoopy=34",
<li>and Chris Weiss's request to round near-decimal numbers (700-639.84 is now 60.16 instead of a few trillionths less).
</ol>

<p><b><a href="dqsd219.exe">Version 2.1.9</a></b> incorporated
<a href="http://members.home.net/greg-mitchell/">Greg Mitchell's</a>
code to do an internet movie database search (**) and
a pricewatch search ($$$).

<p><b><a href="dqsd218.exe">Version 2.1.8</a></b> implemented
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky's</a>
suggestion to mimic the IE address bar's ctrl-enter behavior,
which zaps you to www.<em>just-type-this</em>.com.

<p><b><a href="dqsd217.exe">Version 2.1.7</a></b>
fixed a bug introduced in 2.1.6 where
URLs ending in / resulted in a search instead of going straight
to the page.

<p><b><a href="dqsd216.exe">Version 2.1.6</a></b> incorporated
<a href="http://www.kalsey.com/">Adam Kalsey's</a> code to
search the very cool Wayback Machine with &&, and
<a href="http://www.interney.net/">Edney Soares de Souza's</a>
code to search CNET Download.com with >>.

<p><b><a href="dqsd215.exe">Version 2.1.5</a></b>
thanks to a bug find by Edney Soares de Souza
from Brasil (aka <a href="http://www.interney.net/">InterNey</a>),
setup should now work correctly with Windows 98.

<p><b><a href="dqsd214.exe">Version 2.1.4</a></b>
the popup menu adjusts itself for
smaller screens. Thanks to bob.rtps for the bug report.

<p><b><a href="dqsd211.exe">Version 2.1.1</a></b>
fixed overflow bug in about box,
improved math expression heuristic.

<p><b><a href="dqsd210.exe">Version 2.1.0</a></b>
added FAST, Altavista, Excite, and
Dogpile searches. And you don't need to use a trailing "="
to calculate a math expression any more: we heuristically
discover when you type one in.

<p><b><a href="dqsd201.exe">Version 2.0.1</a></b>
added a few fixes suggested by
Mark Rafn including a better label for the popup menu.

<p><b>Version 2.0.0</b> introduced the NSIS setup script
suggested by Dave Maymudes, so
we have a downloadable self-extracting setup program now.

<h3>Contributors</h3>

<p>Besides <a href="http://davidbau.com/">Dave Bau</a>,
who wrote the thing, some other
people have started to contribute.

<p>Gary Burd was the first user and suggested several
improvements to take advantage of IE's features including
the popup menu. Some improvements are not yet implemented.

<p>Dave Maymudes fixed the popup UI by attaching it to
F1. He also suggested a good approach to open-source
setup (nullsoft NSIS, which was used to generate
the setup exe).

<p>John Rhodes (<a href="http://webword.com/">WebWord</a>) used
the search bar early and promoted it by posting an
<a href="http://www.webword.com/interviews/bau.html">interview</a> on
the widely-read WebWord, which lead the involvement of
several other contributors.

<p>Adam <a href="http://www.kalsey.com/">Kalsey</a>
contributed code to search the wayback machine with &&.
It takes a little longer, but it goes way farther back than
Google's cache.

<p>Edney Soares de Souza (aka <a href="http://www.interney.net/">InterNey</a>)
found a key bug in the Windows 98 setup, and he contributed code to search
CNET Download.com with >>.

<p>Joel ("<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">on software</a>") Spolsky
suggested hooking up ctrl-Enter to fill in "www." and ".com" for you, just
like IE does in the address bar. He also linked to it from his popular
weblog, which lead to several other contributors.

<p><a href="http://members.home.net/greg-mitchell/">Greg Mitchell</a>
contributed Internet Movie Database and PriceWatch searches, and also
the cool Altavista babelfish translator.

<p><a href="http://risser.manilasites.com/">Peter Risser</a>
contributed code to search several online music databases,
and he also contributed the currency exchange utility.

<p><a href="mailto:glenncarr@email.com">Glenn Carr</a> contributed
a number of searches including xref, isbn, half, image, screenit; and
he added the cool search.xml feature where you can add searches in
an external xml file.

<p>Many others on the dqsdd discussion
group have also contributed code; I've tried to give credit properly
in the "What's New" section above. (If I've missed you, please
let me know!)

<p>Finally, thanks to the many people in the Internet community
who have posted <a href="reviews.htm">links and reviews</a> on
the deskbar.

<h3><a name="contributing">Contributing</a></h3>

<p>If you have any ideas on how to improve the
Quick Search Deskbar, please email them to
<a href="mailto:dqsd-users@lists.sourceforge.net">the
dqsd-users@lists.sourceforget.net discussion group</a>.
(You can read an archive of the list at
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dqsd-users@lists.sourceforge.net/">mail-archive.com</a>.)

<p>Or better yet, implement your ideas yourself and post them
to the group. It's
easy. The deskbar's logic is coded entirely in HTML, and its
setup script is an NSIS setup script.

<p>If you've installed the deskbar, the source code is in your
<em><a href="file://c:/Program Files/Quick Search Deskbar/"
target="_blank">Program Files/Quick Search Deskbar</a></em> folder. You can edit
<b>search.htm</b> in that folder to modify the deskbar.
Any modifications will show up in your toolbar after you right-click
on the deskbar's gripper and select the "Refresh" menu item.
You can also open <b>search.htm</b> directly in a web browser to
preview it.

<p>If you want to add new search engines, the easiest way is to
edit <b>search.xml</b>. (Thanks to Glenn Carr for introducing this
mechanism.) You can see how by copying an entry in
that file: to add a new search engine, just write a
javascript function and include any supporting forms that
it might need. You can specify a shortcut and a description that
will show up in the help box.

<p>Please remember that, since the code is licensed under GPL,
you are free to redistribute it, but you must include the source
code and license your distribution under GPL as well.

<p>If you'd like to repackage your modified deskbar as a
redistributable exeuctable, you need to install the
<a href="http://nullsoft.com/free/nsis/">open source nullsoft NSIS
install system</a>. Once you've installed NSIS, all you
need to do is right-click on the <b>search.nsi</b>
file and select "Compile NSI". This will run NSIS and create the
setup executable <b>dqsd.exe</b>.

<p>If you'd like to share your changes with Dave and others,
again <a href="mailto:dqsdd@yahoogroups.com">email</a> or
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dqsdd">post<a> them on
the discussion group so that others can use it, and so
that Dave or others can merge them in to the version on this site.

<p>Or you can merge your contributions in directly by using
the CVS repository on SourceForge. To get write access, you
need a SourceForge account to which Dave or others can
grant permissions. But of course read-only access is open to all.
